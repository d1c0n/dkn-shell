# DKN-shell

This is a C++ implementation of the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview), a POSIX compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo and more.

# Running

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cmake` and `vcpkg` installed locally
2. Run `./run_program.sh` to run the shell, which is implemented in
   `src/main.cpp`.
